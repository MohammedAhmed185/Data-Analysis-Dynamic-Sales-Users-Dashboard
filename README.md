# Introduction

Welcome to the Data Analysis Sales Project! This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of sales data from the years 2020 and 2021. The primary goal of this project is to uncover key insights and trends that have driven the company's profitability during this period. This analysis was conducted using Power BI, a powerful data visualization and business intelligence tool.

Through this analysis, we have identified several critical factors contributing to the company's success. In 2020, we observed a significant increase in profits, largely driven by the popularity of a specific product, Detergent 1L, which benefited from a strategic 10% discount. Although soap was the most sold product in terms of quantity, Detergent 1L played a crucial role in maximizing revenue.

Moreover, our analysis highlights that the retail-grocery outlet class was the most effective in driving revenue growth. We also identified the top three customers, Amgad, Baher, and Mohamed Hussein, who made substantial contributions to our sales figures. Additionally, March emerged as the most profitable month for the company.

This project leverages various data analysis techniques in Power BI to provide a detailed understanding of the sales performance, helping to inform future strategies and decision-making processes. We invite you to explore the repository and discover the valuable insights we have uncovered.
